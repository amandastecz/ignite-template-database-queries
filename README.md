# ðŸ’» About the challenge

In this challenge, you will perform database queries with TypeORM in three ways:

- Using the ORM
- Using Query Builder
- Using Raw Query

This will help you understand and exercise the different types of queries we can do.

In the template, you will find an application already structured (only the entities and repositories) where you will have to complete what is missing in the queries of the two repositories.
